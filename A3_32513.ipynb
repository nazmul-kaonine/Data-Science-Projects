        "## AIMS\n",
        "The future of retail can be solely described as consumer choices becoming less complicated and stress-free. The potential and very practical future retail industry seems to be the one that has screens, robotic machinery, virtual dressing rooms, visualizations of the product benefits and tailored product services. This surely requires retailers to become intimidating players in the AI space (Manyika 2017). With international retail giants like Amazon knocking on the door of the Australian local market, disruption in the retail industry is forecasted by experts. The blueprint of this disruption is Amazon's robust people-tracking system and data-collecting approach that enables this organization to facilitate checkout-free retail services. The service called \"Amazon Go\" that detects products taken by the customer and automatically charging their Amazon account is to be rolled out to 3000 stores in the US alone by 2021 (Polacco & Backes 2018). This document proposes a different approach to counter-act Amazon's new service by providing customers a hassle-free shopping experience through tailored \"pick-up and leave\" grocery service using transaction data. This is one step ahead of Amazon's idea in the sense that customers do not need to physically handle the items or search through the supermarket. They will receive an accurate list of grocery items that they only need to approve before they are handed over making it incredibly convenient for the work-indulged consumers. To achieve this, the objectives of this project have been divided into 3 sections: \n",
        "\n",
        "1) The data-collection process from purchase summaries of selected grocery items bought in large amounts including customer's demographics. \n",
        "\n",
        "2) Evaluate several models that will outline the customer's future purchases of various products thereby providing individualzied offers on different items. \n",
        "\n",
        "3) After modelling, it is crucial to validate this approach and gradually deploying it in the Australian retail industry in online and offline space.\n",
        "\n",
        "## BACKGROUND\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of artificial intelligence in retail is not a new invention. Replacing human labor by machines that can simulate human behavior have proven to be successful in numerous instances (Murdoch 1990). IBM Watson's \"Gifts When You Need (GWYN)\" model\n",
        "takes information provided by consumers about the gift recipient and tailors its recommendation by matching with gifts purchased by similar recipients. A company named \"1-800 Flowers.com\" adapted this approach  and resulted in 70% of online orders through GWYN in the first two months. Another company called \"NorthFace\" also used this approach converted 75% of its total sales by recommending jackets based on the consumer's location and gender.\n",
        "Although chatbots have proven to be a technology that might no longer be used to address customer intents, another form of AI that replicates a sales agent is making groundbreaking progress. This automated sales assistant \"Rachel\" from the company \"Conversica\" achieved 30% email response rate within hours after identifying and communicating with customers on the internet (Terry et al. 2019). Furthermore, it saves their data automatically and customers enjoy this experience.\n",
        "In 2010 a 70% increase in foot traffic in a store in California was recorded due to the involvement of a humanoid robot named \"Pepper\" that can understand human emotions and interact accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The proposed project implements a system that is closely related to the above scenarios. It requires an implementation of screens inside supermarkets just like one the \"Pepper\" robot carries. Customers can tap their rewards/ flybuy cards and receive a machine-discovered list of their everyday grocery items that they can approve with a single click. The model will check previous grocery sales history of everyday items and suggest similar items where the previous supply has run out. This recommendation works in a similar way like IBM's GWYN. Furthermore this \"Rachel-like\" sales agent will also provide relevant promotions on new items inside the indiviudals space of interest and pass grocery reminders online. At the end of their shopping, customers can pick up their grocery from the checkout by matching their rewards card with their purchased order or simply get home delivery through automated online order.\n",
        "\n",
        "## RESEARCH PROJECT\n",
        "\n",
        "###Significance\n",
        "While the world is implementing AI to solve their tiniest problems, the Australian local market is still following traditional retail measures. It is not a surprise that this industry collects customer data in a huge amount. This data has the potential to revolutionise retail procedures increasing revenue and forecasting sales. Unfortunately, in the offline space, the fruits of this knowledge have not been utilised. With online retail giants like Amazon emerging into the offline space, the local supermarkets such as Coles, Woolworths and Aldi need to implement similar practices to enchant customers with the most comfortable shopping experience within a short time frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Innovation\n",
        "The project uses the biggest advantage that Australian retailers have over entry-level international organizations i.e. existing customer data. This is just the beginning of shortlisting customer's preferences and implementing a \"pick-up and leave service\". Since over 5 million Australians prefer to buy their groceries online, this change can provide a \"queue free online-like\" experience as opposed to traditional online cart scenarios where customers undergo prolonged browsing and selecting efforts. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###Project plan\n",
        "This project involves machine learning at its core. The data from a customer's purchase summary shown below are taken as inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. purchase amounts on grocery\n",
        "\n",
        "2. interval between purchases\n",
        "\n",
        "3. price and quantity of items\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Combination of items under categories\n",
        "\n",
        "5. expiry date of items\n",
        "\n",
        "6. duration of probable consumption\n",
        "\n",
        "7. high volume products from last month \n",
        "\n",
        "This data is combined with the customer's demographics that are combined together to get insights such as food habits, average expenditure on groceries and regular items flags (Turner, Morrin & Gilbert 2006).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. age\n",
        "\n",
        "9. gender\n",
        "\n",
        "10. marital_status\n",
        "\n",
        "11. number_of_dependants\n",
        "\n",
        "12. city_type\n",
        "\n",
        "13. city_name\n",
        "\n",
        "14. holiday_events\n",
        "\n",
        "15. email_address\n",
        "\n",
        "16. weather\n",
        "\n",
        "Taking this input data from the last 5 years, the final output is the customer's highest purchase amount dedicated towards each item. Items having the highest purchase amounts are listed and shown to the customer upon arrival. The algorithm is implemented using Python programming language in a notebook environment after calling certain useful libraries such as numpy, skitlearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, etc. To give a brief idea about the coding language we show some pieces of similar code to be used in the process:\n"
