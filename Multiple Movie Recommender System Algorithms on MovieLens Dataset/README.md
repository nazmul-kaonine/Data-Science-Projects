This project deals with the movielens dataset in order to build a Movie Recommendation Engine. 
First I have looked upon existing techniques such as User-User and User-Item similarity. 
6 similaries i.e. Jaccard, Cosine, Euclidean, Correlation, l1 regularization, l2 regularization were compared through RMSD, recall and precision values.
Recommendation through each technique was provided. 
Due to the low evaluation results, I built a new model based on customer demographics which gave a much better accuracy.
