This project detects blood cells from digital images.
Google object detection API is used to detect the objects as trained previously on xml annotation files.
Two APIs were tested in this instance, SSD and Faster R-CNN where SSD gave faster results.
The objects were also classified into RBC and WBC (Red blood cells & white blood cells) as trained before on the train set images.
