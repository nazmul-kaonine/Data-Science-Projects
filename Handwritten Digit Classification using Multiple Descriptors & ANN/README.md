This project detects handwritten Digits from the popular MNIST dataset.
The classifiers used here are KNN, SVM and Artificial Neural Network. Multiple hyperparameter tunings were implemented of each classifier.
A number of descriptors were used such as HOG, PCA, LBP to compare accuracies. 
It was found that LBP is not a good descriptor to use for such classification.
Other evaluation criteria: Precision & Recall.
