A basic machine learning implementation where customer demographic data was provided.
Data was preprocessed such as missing values were approached, feature engineering such as addition of new columns was performed and outliers were removed.
Categorical values were converted to numerical values to be used in testing the algorithm.
6 alogirthms: KNN, SVM, NB, Dtree, K-means, LR were used in finding out the most accurate algorithm and tuning needed to get the best possible accuracy.
The achieved accuracy was then compared to raw accuracy (if feature engineering was not performed).

Future Implementation: A great addition can be: while updating the missing values we can use another machine learning algorithm to find out the best possible candidates for the gaps. Therefore, using one machine learning algorithm to optimize the testing of another.
