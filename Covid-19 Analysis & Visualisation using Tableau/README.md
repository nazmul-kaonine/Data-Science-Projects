This is a visualisation I build that expresses how Covid has affected the world in 2020. Users can choose a country, check the countries and its states with the most cases, deaths, active and confirmed cases. An extra column was added is the ratio of active and confirmed cases to find out how dangerous that region is. The viz was made on a map with pie charts, bar charts, scatter plot and area maps.
Future implementation can be a tree map bar chart on separate pages.
