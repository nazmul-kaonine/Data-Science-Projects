This project to classify fruit images consists of two successful attempts.

A baseline architecture: 6 architectures were tested. They are: resnet50, resnet50v2, resnet101, VGG16, VGG19 and mobilenet.
Resnet50 was then used to create the baseline architecture according to operational speed and accuracy (67%).

A customized architecture: The resnet50 architecture was then modified (layers were added and removed) to make a better architecture in terms of accuracy and speed. Accuracy increased to 98%.
